# What is Researcher?

Researcher is a (mostly) data-driven research system for Minecraft inspired by Factorio.

> [!NOTE]
> This mod does nothing on its own, and is meant to be used by other mods or datapacks.

## Use Cases

Why would someone use Researcher?

- **To create a natural progression for a mod / modpack**

  Researcher allows you to lock recipes behind researches, so a mod could gradually
  introduce its features as the player progresses. Additionally, as Researcher is
  data-driven, a modpack author would easily be able to integrate many mods together
  by overriding researches.

- **To take advantage of Researcher's criterion system**

  Each criteria in a vanilla advancement is completed after being triggered a single
  time. This means having an advancement unlock after crafting, say, 5 furnaces is
  fundamentally impossible. Researcher tackles this by counting the number of times
  the criterion is triggered, allowing for more challenging tasks.

If you've played Factorio before, researches are similar to trigger technologies.
